# AJAX ToDo List Project - Week 07 HW
## Description

Show case the implementation of AJAX in Rails and manipulation of rails scaffolding, to showcase a "single page" app. Furthermore,  implement bootstrap static modals for rerouting the editing and show pages in one single static element.  

## Synopsis

In the AJAX ToDo List app, i have merged the  `<creation>`, and `<index>` to be shown the action in a single page. 





Withe use of Bootstrap static modals for both `<show>` & `<edit>`, one can easily create changes with the same `<index>` page

Edit Modal: ![Edit Modal](url)


Show Modal: ![Show Modall](url)


Utilizing Turbolinks & JavaScript, i was able to focus the `<create>` _task name box_, so that this string text tag stays activated continuously without the need for reloading of the entire page.
